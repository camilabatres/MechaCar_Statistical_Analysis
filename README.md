## Linear Regresson to Predict MPG 
*Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Out of the 5 variables, the vehicle length and ground_clearance are the two variables that provide a non-random amount of variance due to the small p-value/high significant level. 


2Q. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

2A. The slope is not considered to be zero because some independent values had a significant relationship with mpg. 

3Q. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

3A. The R-square for this model is .7149, the model is not fully reliable but it is close to 1. This means that the value is generally considered a moderate effect size.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
* The results show that the variance is 62.29356. Even though the variance is below the limit of 100 pounds per square inch, the per lot table grouped data shows that the variance is 170 which is above 100.
